# Generate APK in React Native CLI

In this guide, we'll cover the steps to generate an APK (Android Package) file from a React Native project using the React Native CLI. This is useful when you want to test your app on an Android device or share it with others for testing.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed and set up:

- **React Native CLI**: Ensure you have initialized your React Native project.
- **Android Studio**: Required for building Android apps and managing Android SDKs.
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Make sure Java is installed (Java 11 is recommended).

You may also need to set up the following environment variables:

```bash
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

# Step 1: Navigate to Your Project Directory

Open your terminal and navigate to your React Native project directory:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
```

# In macOS

On macOS, if you're not sure where your JDK bin folder is, then perform the following command to find it:

```bash
/usr/libexec/java_home
```

It will output the directory of the JDK, which will look something like this:

```bash
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdkX.X.X_XXX.jdk/Contents/Home
```

You can open Home folder like this in mac from terminal

```bash
open Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdkX.X.X_XXX.jdk/Contents/Home
```

Navigate to that directory by using the command cd /your/jdk/path and use the keytool command with sudo permission as shown below.

```bash
sudo keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-upload-key.keystore -alias my-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

# Setting up Gradle variables

1. Place the my-upload-key.keystore file under the android/app
2. directory in your project folder.
   Edit the file ~/.gradle/gradle.properties or android/gradle.properties, and add the following (replace **\*** with the correct keystore password, alias and key password),

# Adding signing config to your app's Gradle config

The last configuration step that needs to be done is to setup release builds to be signed using upload key. Edit the file android/app/build.gradle in your project folder, and add the signing config,

```bash
...
android {
...
defaultConfig { ... }
signingConfigs {
release {
if (project.hasProperty('MYAPP_UPLOAD_STORE_FILE')) {
storeFile file(MYAPP_UPLOAD_STORE_FILE)
storePassword MYAPP_UPLOAD_STORE_PASSWORD
keyAlias MYAPP_UPLOAD_KEY_ALIAS
keyPassword MYAPP_UPLOAD_KEY_PASSWORD
}
}
}
buildTypes {
release {
...
signingConfig signingConfigs.release
}
}
}
...
```

# Build the Signed APK

```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

## This above command will generate the APK at:

```bash
android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

## Locate the APK

```bash
android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```
